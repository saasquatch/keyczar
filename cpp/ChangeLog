	Release 0.70

	- Added support for session encryption.  This allows the user to
	  encrypt using a session key.  The data is encrypted with a
	  randomly-generated session key and then signed with a provided
	  Signer.  The session key is encrypted with a provided
	  Encrypter.
	- Fixed AES key hashing bug.  Prior to this release, leading zero
	  bytes were erroneously trimmed from AES keys before hashing them
	  to produce a key "fingerprint" which is embedded in encrypted
	  messages to identify the encryption key.  This meant that the
	  different Keyczar libraries were incompatible when using AES
	  keys with leading zeros.  The fix corrects this incompatibility,
	  but preserves the ability to decrypt messages encrypted by
	  previous versions of the C++ library (though previous versions
	  may not be able to decrypt messages encrypted by 0.70 or
	  above).

	Release 0.71

	- String to int conversion bug fix
	- KeyczarTool uses same --size=256 in compat mode for consistency
	  between python and java
	- AES IV for 192 and 256 bit uses correct value now.
	- Support added for FreeBSD 8+9
	- Fixed OpenSSL pem bug that caused unit test failure
	- Thread safety issues with SHA1 corrected.
	- Several memory leaks fixed including ones in base64 conversion.
	- Keyczart supports "--size" flag for "addkey".

	Release 0.71a

	- SHA224 worked incorrectly due to recent fix breaking non compat
	  mode tests.

2014-06-04 Daryl Seah <darylseah@google.com>

	Release 0.71b

	- Moved Value class from global namespace to Keyczar namespace to
	  avoid conflicts.
	- Fixed missing return statements in keyset.cc and keyczar_tool.cc.
